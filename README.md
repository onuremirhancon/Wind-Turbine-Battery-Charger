# Wind-Turbine-Battery-Charger

This project was done within the scope of EE463 Static Power Conversion I Course in the Department of Electrical Electronics Engineering of the Middle East Techincal University.

## Project Description

In this project you are required to design a battery charger. The input power of the charger is supplied by a small wind turbine generator. Your design should regulate the incoming power from wind turbine generator to feed the load and charge the battery. Thus, an AC to DC type power converter circuit has to be designed with required control actions because there are limitations for batteries in terms of their voltage and charge. Propose a solution which can regulate the output current while the input voltage is varied because of the changing wind speed.

You are free to choose any topology such as (but not limited to):

Three-Phase Thyristor Rectifier
Three-Phase Diode Rectifier + Buck Converter

## Project Specifications

Specifications of the system are listed as follows:

- Input voltage: 15 Vline-to-line to 25 Vline-to-line
